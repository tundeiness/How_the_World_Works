# How the world works Cornerstone Project
## Exercise One: Fake it Til You Make it
- Import required libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and pyplot
- Explored the libraries
- Creating random samples with Numpy and creating sample for sine wave and Tan wave(sine and tan wave       simulation)
- Simulating Noise to make data realistic
- Importing data using pandas read_csv
- Exploring Normal Distribution and standard deviation values as it affects normal distribution shapes
- Implement Sport Betting exercise. 
## Generation of artificial dataset based on predetermined mapping functions
