# How the world works Cornerstone Project
## Exercise One: Fake it Til You Make it
- Import required libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and pyplot
- Explored the libraries
-Generating placeholder data using np.linspace
- Creating random samples with Numpy and creating sample for sine wave and Tan wave(sine and tan wave       simulation)
- Simulating Noise to make data realistic
- Importing data using pandas read_csv
- Exploring Normal Distribution and standard deviation values as it affects normal distribution shapes
- Implement Sport Betting exercise. 
## Generation of artificial dataset based on predetermined mapping functions
## generating noise
## applying different models on the artificial datasets

## comparing models of varying complexities and abilities to separate signal from noise

## Exercise Two: Building Simple Mean Models and Linear Regression Models
- Mean Model
- visually evaluate how the mean model "fits" the training data using graphs
  1. overlay the mean model predictions with the original dataset using plt.plot() for line plot and plt.scatter() to plot the training data. 
- evaluate mean model visually
- implement linear regression model using scikit learn module
- evaluate linear regression model vs training data

### Introduction to Model Parameters 

                #### Model     |     #### Model Parameter

     Mean Model                |   average value of y
     Linear Regression Model   |   intercept and coefficient
